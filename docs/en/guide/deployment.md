# Deployment Guide

This page is organized according to the current runtime scripts, mainly covering:

- `scripts/docker-entrypoint.x86.sh`
- `scripts/start.sh`
- `scripts/run_start.sh`
- `scripts/install.sh`

## x86 Docker Runtime

Start:

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.yml up -d --build
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell/CMD)**:
  ```powershell
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.windows.yml up -d --build
  ```

Stop:

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.yml down
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell/CMD)**:
  ```powershell
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.windows.yml down
  ```

View logs:

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.yml logs -f
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell/CMD)**:
  ```powershell
  docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.windows.yml logs -f
  ```

## Runtime Directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<INSTALLPATH>` | Main installation directory, set by the Dockerfile or deployment scripts |
| `<INSTALLPATH>/resource` | Runtime resource directory |
| `<DATADIR>` | User persistent data directory, by default located on a persistent volume |
| `<DATADIR>/log/logs` | Log directory |
| `<DATADIR>/upgrade` | Upgrade package directory |

## Runtime Processes

The startup scripts launch:

- `nginx` (system, `/usr/sbin/nginx`)
- `srs`
- `cosmo-engine`

Corresponding paths:

`${INSTALLPATH}` is set by the `INSTALLPATH` environment variable in the Dockerfile (default value see Runtime Configuration).
Specific paths:
```text
/usr/sbin/nginx  (system nginx)
${INSTALLPATH}/bin/srs
${INSTALLPATH}/bin/cosmo-engine
```

## Default Ports

| Port | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `8080 -> 80` | `docker-compose.x86.yml` / `docker-compose.x86.windows.yml` | x86 Docker web console |
| `1936` | `docker-compose.x86.yml` / `docker-compose.x86.windows.yml` / SRS | RTMP |
| `1985` | `docker-compose.x86.yml` / `docker-compose.x86.windows.yml` / SRS | SRS API |
| `18088` | `docker-compose.x86.yml` / `docker-compose.x86.windows.yml` / SRS | HTTP stream |
| `8000` | `src/app/AppConstants.h` (`kDefaultHttpPort`) | Backend HTTP |
| `9000` | `src/app/AppConstants.h` (`kDefaultWebSocketPort`) | Backend WebSocket |

`8080->80`, `1936`, `1985`, and `18088` are exposed to the host. `8000` and `9000` are in-container process ports. In `docker-compose.x86.yml`, `8000` is mapped as `8000:8000/udp` for device discovery, which is distinct from the backend HTTP (TCP). The host accesses the API through nginx, which reverse-proxies from in-container `80` to host `8080`.

The production UDP discovery protocol accepts only `probe` queries. Network-card changes, hardware-information writes, and authorization-code operations are no longer executed over multicast: use an implemented authenticated management API, while operations without a secure replacement API are rejected.

Stream environment variables set by the runtime scripts:

```bash
COSMO_STREAM_PLAY_MODE=srs
COSMO_STREAM_RTMP_BASE=rtmp://127.0.0.1:1936/live
COSMO_STREAM_RTC_API_PORT=1985
COSMO_STREAM_HTTP_PORT=18088
```

## Release Package Structure

The install/upgrade scripts expect the release package to contain:

- `bin`
- `files`
- `font`
- `scripts`
- `web`

Optional or handled by presence:

- `lib`
- `resource`

Upgrade package filename pattern:

```text
cosmo-V<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<32-char-md5>.tar.gz
```

## systemd Service

`scripts/install.sh` creates:

```text
/etc/systemd/system/cosmo.service
```

Service start command:

```text
ExecStart=${INSTALLPATH}/scripts/inte_run_start.sh
```

## Interface Documentation Static Links

Packaged interface files:

- `data/Interface/ai-box-interface_v1.0.html`
- `data/Interface/mqtt_v1.0.html`

Linked at runtime to:

- `web/staticfile/httpInterface.html`
- `web/staticfile/mqttInterface.html`
