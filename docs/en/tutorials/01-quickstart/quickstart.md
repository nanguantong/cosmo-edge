## Step 1: Hardware Connection

Connect the device to your local network and power it on.

1. Use an Ethernet cable to connect the device's **ETH port** to your router or switch.

<!-- Image showing the Ethernet port -->

2. **Plug in the power adapter.**

<!-- Image showing the power port -->

![](images/img_04.webp)

3. Wait approximately **60 seconds** for the device to finish booting.

**Expected status indicators:**

- Power LED (PWR): Solid on (red)

<!-- Image showing the power LED -->

![](images/img_05.webp)

- Network LED (WAN): Blinking (indicates a healthy network connection)

<!-- Image showing the network LED -->

4. **Configure a static IP on your computer**

   On your computer, go to **Start** → **Control Panel** → **Network and Internet** → **Network and Sharing Center** → **Change adapter settings** → **Ethernet**. (A direct connection between the device and your computer is recommended for initial setup.)

<!-- Screenshot of network adapter settings -->

![](images/img_07.webp)

5. Double-click the Ethernet adapter and open **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

<!-- Screenshot of TCP/IPv4 properties -->

![](images/img_08.webp)

6. Set the IP address and subnet mask to be on the same subnet as the CosmoEdge device, then click **OK**.

<!-- Screenshot of IP address configuration -->

![](images/img_09.webp)

**💡 The default CosmoEdge address is: WAN: 192.168.100.1**

## Step 2: Access the Management Console and Configure System Settings

Open a browser and navigate to the device's IP address.

1. We recommend **Chrome** or **Edge**.
2. In the address bar, enter: `http://<device IP>` (e.g., `http://192.168.100.1`)

<!-- Screenshot of browser navigation -->

![](images/img_10.webp)

3. Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin` (we strongly recommend changing this after first login)

<!-- Screenshot of login page -->

![](images/img_11.webp)

After a successful login, you'll see the **System Dashboard**, which displays the following key metrics:

|   Metric    |                 Description                  |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------: |
|  CPU Usage  |                Processor load                |
| VRAM Usage  |    Video memory consumed by loaded tasks     |
|  NPU Usage  |         Neural processing unit load          |
| eMMC Usage  |          System storage utilization          |
| Packet Loss | If above 10%, system performance may degrade |

Go to **System Management** → **System Settings** → **Time Settings** → **Manual Sync** → **Sync with Computer**. (Since the device is directly connected, it can't automatically obtain the correct time.)

<!-- Screenshot of time sync settings -->

![](images/img_12.webp)

Go to **System Management** → **Network Configuration** to change the device's IP address so it's on the same subnet as your LAN. (This lets your computer access the console while still having internet connectivity.)

<!-- Screenshot of network configuration -->

![](images/img_13.webp)

> **⚠️ Can't access the management console?**
>
> - Make sure the device and your computer are on the **same subnet**.
> - Try connecting the device directly to your computer with an Ethernet cable (bypassing the router).
> - Check whether your browser is using a proxy — disable it and try again.

## Step 3: View Live AI Detection Results

The device comes pre-loaded with several demo scenarios using **built-in demo videos** as data sources — no cameras needed to experience the full AI detection workflow. We'll use **Pedestrian Flow Counting** as our example.

1. **Download the pedestrian flow demo video**

   Demo video download link: [github.com/cosmo-wander-ai/cosmo-edge/releases/tag/v1.0-videos](https://github.com/cosmo-wander-ai/cosmo-edge/releases/tag/v1.0-videos)

---

2. **Upload the pedestrian flow demo video**

   In the Task Configuration menu, click **Video Sources**, then click **Add**.

<!-- Screenshot of video source page -->

![](images/img_14.webp)

In the dialog that appears:

- Source type: Offline Video
- Channel name: Give it a descriptive name, e.g., **Building 1 East Corridor**
- Upload video: Upload the demo MP4 file, then click **Save**.

<!-- Screenshot of add channel dialog -->

Click **Scenario Task Assignment**.

<!-- Screenshot of task assignment button -->

3. **Assign an algorithm to the channel**

   Configure the video analytics algorithm for the channel.

<!-- Screenshot of algorithm assignment -->

![](images/img_17.webp)

Page layout overview:

<!-- Screenshot showing the three functional areas -->

![](images/img_18.webp)

The Service Assignment page has three main areas:

- **Area 1**: All available algorithm types — Detection/Analysis, Face/Body, Counting/Statistics.
- **Area 2**: Controls for starting, stopping, and deleting services on the channel.
- **Area 3**: Service configuration panel — detection region setup, parameter tuning, runtime strategy, etc.

Under **Counting/Statistics**, find **Pedestrian Flow Counting** and select it.

<!-- Screenshot of selecting pedestrian flow counting -->

![](images/img_19.webp)

The configuration parameters for the selected algorithm will appear. The pedestrian flow counting algorithm works by detecting pedestrians crossing a detection line. Key controls include:

- **Draw**: Draw a detection line.
- **Direction Toggle**: Switch the crossing direction for one-sided counting.
- **Delete**: Remove the detection line.

<!-- Screenshot of detection line parameters -->

> **💡 Configuration Parameters**
>
> Parameters are determined by the algorithm's pipeline orchestration.

**Draw the detection line**

Click **Draw**, then click once in the video to set the starting point, and click again to set the endpoint. (The line counts pedestrians crossing in the direction of the arrow.)

<!-- Screenshot of drawing process -->

<!-- Screenshot of completed line -->

![](images/img_22.webp)

Click **Finish Drawing** to save. The detection line is now configured.

<!-- Screenshot of saved detection line -->

![](images/img_23.webp)

**Set the runtime strategy**

Set the play count to 0 for looping playback.

<!-- Screenshot of runtime strategy -->

![](images/img_24.webp)

Click **Save**. This assigns the pedestrian flow counting algorithm to the channel and simultaneously starts the analysis service.

<!-- Screenshot of save confirmation -->

![](images/img_25.webp)

Return to the **Video Sources** menu. The "Running" toggle being on indicates the service is active.

<!-- Screenshot of running status -->

4. **Algorithm Visualization**

Click **Live Preview** to enter the visualization page.

<!-- Screenshot of live preview entry -->

![](images/img_27.webp)

The visualization page has three areas:

- **Left panel**: All service channels in the system.
- **Center area**: Visual algorithm display — select a channel to view.
- **Right panel**: Real-time scrolling alarm feed from all active algorithm tasks.

<!-- Screenshot of visualization page layout -->

![](images/img_28.webp)

> **💡 Layout Options**
> Use the toggle in the upper-right corner to switch between **single view** and **quad view** layouts.

Select the **Building 1 East Corridor** channel to stream its algorithm-enhanced video.

<!-- Screenshot of channel selection -->

![](images/img_29.webp)

Under algorithm overlay, select **Pedestrian Flow Counting**. Different algorithms have different overlay behaviors.

<!-- Screenshot of overlay selection -->

> **💡 Overlay Logic**
>
> Each algorithm's pipeline strategy determines its own overlay behavior.

**Overlay results:**

<!-- Screenshot of overlay results -->

![](images/img_31.webp)

The visualization includes:

1. **Pedestrian detection**: Object class and confidence score, e.g., `Pedestrian: 0.91`
2. **Pedestrian tracking**: Unique track ID for each person, e.g., `#1318`
3. **Pipeline timing**: Upper-left area shows per-component latency breakdown.
4. **Counting results**: Upper-right area shows IN/OUT pedestrian flow totals.

## Step 4: View Statistics

All AI-detected alarms and statistical events are automatically recorded and can be reviewed later.

1. In the left navigation, click **Event Center** → **Counting/Statistics**.

<!-- Screenshot of event center navigation -->

2. Select **Query Events** → **Channel Name** → **Algorithm Service** → click **Query**. (Click Query again to refresh with the latest real-time statistics.)

<!-- Screenshot of query results -->
