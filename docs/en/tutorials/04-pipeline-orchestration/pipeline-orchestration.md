# Volume 4: Pipeline Orchestration

> **Estimated time**: 35–50 minutes
> **Goal**: Understand the internal structure of scenario tasks, learn to modify existing pipelines, and build new scenario tasks from scratch using built-in capabilities
> **Prerequisites**: Completed [Volume 2: Scenario Configuration](../02-scenario-config/scenario-config.md) and [Volume 3: VLM / DINO Guide](../03-vlm-guide/vlm-guide.md); familiar with video sources, service assignment, live preview, and alarm records
> **No extra environment needed**: This tutorial only uses built-in capabilities — no Docker or model conversion involved

In the first three volumes, you learned two things:

1. How to configure common detection scenarios using built-in CV algorithms.
2. How to define new detection rules using VLM / DINO.

But up to this point, you've mainly been "using pre-built capabilities."

This tutorial takes you one level deeper: **understanding how those capabilities are organized, and learning to orchestrate them yourself.**

Three progressive chapters:

- Chapter 1: Read and understand existing scenario task internals
- Chapter 2: Modify an existing scenario task
- Chapter 3: Build a new scenario task from scratch

> **Note**
>
> This tutorial covers "how to organize capabilities."
> The next tutorial, Volume 5: Model Porting, covers "how to bring in new third-party model capabilities."

## Learning Path

```plain
Read and understand existing scenario tasks
  ↓
Make small modifications to existing tasks
  ↓
Build new scenario tasks by referencing existing structure
```

After completing this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Understand what a scenario task does internally
- Judge where a given node belongs in the pipeline
- Independently add, remove, and reconfigure nodes
- Build new business logic using built-in capabilities

## Chapter 1: Understanding Scenario Task Pipelines

In the Scenario Configuration Guide, you primarily worked on the "Service Assignment" page — selecting algorithms, drawing regions, and tuning parameters. Behind the scenes, each of these operations maps to a **scenario task pipeline**.

Each scenario task is essentially a processing chain:

```plain
Input → Inference → Logic → Output
```

This chapter is read-only — no modifications.

### 1.1 Open the "No Hard Hat" Scenario Task

### 1.2 Common Node Types

**Input Nodes**

| Node         | Purpose                                       | Notes                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Video Decode | Decodes a video stream into individual frames | Starting point for nearly every scenario task |

**Inference Nodes**

| Node                   | Purpose                           | Notes                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Object Detection       | Locates targets in the frame      | e.g., pedestrian detection, hard hat detection |
| Object Classification  | Re-classifies detected targets    | e.g., determining hard hat status              |
| Tracking               | Assigns stable IDs to targets     | Maintains identity across frames               |
| Vision Language Model  | Performs state judgment on images | e.g., "Is the door open or closed?"            |
| Detection Vision Model | Detects targets from text prompts | e.g., "garbage bin," "fire cabinet"            |

**Logic Nodes**

| Node                    | Purpose                                              | Notes                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Category Filter         | Keeps only specified classes                         | Drops irrelevant detection results                     |
| Size Filter             | Filters targets that are too small or large          | Eliminates noise from distant small objects            |
| Region Judgment         | Checks if a target is inside a defined region        | Corresponds to the detection regions drawn in Volume 2 |
| Line Crossing           | Checks if a target crosses a defined line            | Used for pedestrian flow counting                      |
| Sensitivity Calculation | Requires multiple consecutive hits before triggering | Reduces single-frame false positives                   |

**Output Nodes**

| Node            | Purpose                | Notes                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Event Reporting | Generates alarm events | Visible in the alarm records |

> **Tip**
>
> You don't need to memorize every node.
> A more efficient approach: find the closest built-in scenario task and modify it.

### 1.3 How Data Flows Between Nodes

Looking at the "No Hard Hat" pipeline, data flows roughly like this:

```plain
Video Decode
  ↓ Output: individual frames
Object Detection (pedestrian detection)
  ↓ Output: bounding boxes + classes + confidence
Object Tracking
  ↓ Output: bounding boxes + classes + confidence + track sequence
Category Filter
  ↓ Output: only the target class retained
Object Classification (hard hat classification)
  ↓ Output: hard hat status for each person
Sensitivity Calculation
  ↓ Output: triggers alarm only after consecutive hits
Event Reporting
  ↓ Output: structured alarm event
Video Visualization Overlay
  ↓ Output: bounding boxes, labels, and alerts on the live feed
```

Once you understand this flow, most scenario tasks become readable:

- Each node consumes the output of the previous node.
- Each node does exactly one thing.
- Node order directly affects the final result.

### 1.4 Principles for Node Ordering

When orchestrating pipelines, follow these guidelines:

1. **Filter invalid results as early as possible.**
   For example, targets that are too small should be filtered before they reach classification or complex logic nodes.
2. **Generate targets first, then apply rules.**
   Region judgment, line crossing, and sensitivity all require upstream detection results.
3. **If you want results visible in the live preview, you typically need a visualization overlay node.**
   Event reporting alone will generate alarm records, but won't show bounding boxes on screen.

## Chapter 2: Modifying an Existing Scenario Task

Let's make a practical improvement to the "No Hard Hat" pipeline we examined earlier.

### Scenario Description

In the hard hat detection scenario from Volume 2, distant and very small pedestrians sometimes get detected. But these targets have too few pixels for reliable classification, leading to false positives. The fix: add a **Size Filter** node to the pipeline, so the system automatically ignores targets that are too small.

### 2.1 Add a Category Filter Node

Continuing from Section 1.1, add a size filter between **Object Detection** and **Object Tracking**.

1. Click the add button between **Object Detection** and **Object Tracking**.

<!-- Screenshot of add button position -->

![](images/img_05.webp)

2. Click **Add Component**.

<!-- Screenshot of add component menu -->

![](images/img_06.webp)

<!-- Screenshot of component panel -->

![](images/img_07.webp)

Components are organized into two categories:

- **Algorithm Actions**: Model-related components (object detection, feature extraction, etc.)
- **Business Processing**: Workflow components (video decode, event reporting, etc.)

3. Select the **Category Filter** component.

<!-- Screenshot of category filter selection -->

![](images/img_08.webp)

The Category Filter node is inserted at the expected position.

<!-- Screenshot of inserted node -->

![](images/img_09.webp)

> **Why here?**
>
> The goal of size filtering is to eliminate invalid targets as early as possible.
> Waiting until after tracking, classification, or downstream rule processing wastes compute and increases false positives.

4. Configure the business logic

   Click the **Category Filter** component to expand its configuration panel.

<!-- Screenshot of category filter config -->

![](images/img_10.webp)

The **Category Filter** component has these settings:

- **Target Label**: Select which labels to keep.
- **Enable Minimum Size**: Toggle minimum size filtering on/off.

Set the target label to **Pedestrian** — only pedestrian results pass through; all other labels are dropped.

<!-- Screenshot of label selection -->

![](images/img_11.webp)

Enable **Minimum Size** — detection results below this threshold will be discarded.

<!-- Screenshot of min size toggle -->

![](images/img_12.webp)

The default minimum size is **60×60** pixels. You can customize this value.

### 2.2 Configure Key Parameters

**Minimum size filtering principle**: When set to 60, any detection target with an area smaller than 60×60 pixels will be filtered out.

Click **Parameter Configuration** to open the parameter settings page.

<!-- Screenshot of parameter page -->

![](images/img_13.webp)

Set **Minimum Pedestrian Size** to 40, meaning the minimum target area is 40×40 pixels.

<!-- Screenshot of min size setting -->

![](images/img_14.webp)

> **Tuning advice**
>
> Start by setting the minimum size to `100` to see if it's too aggressive.
> Then gradually decrease to `40–60` to find the optimal balance for your scenario.

### 2.4 Save and Verify

1. Click **Save**.

<!-- Screenshot of save confirmation -->

![](images/img_15.webp)

2. Go to **Video Sources** → **Service Assignment** and find the **No Hard Hat** channel.

<!-- Screenshot of service assignment -->

![](images/img_16.webp)

3. Start the **No Hard Hat** service.

<!-- Screenshot of service started -->

![](images/img_17.webp)

4. Go to **Live Preview** to observe the changes.

<!-- Screenshot of live preview -->

![](images/img_18.webp)

Select the **Construction Site North Channel** and enter full screen.

<!-- Screenshot of full screen preview -->

![](images/img_19.webp)

Algorithm overlay visualization:

<!-- Screenshot of overlay with filter active -->

![](images/img_20.webp)

Results analysis:

- Distant, excessively small pedestrians (red box highlighted) are now noticeably fewer.
- Nearby, clearly visible targets still detect and classify normally.
- False positive count has decreased.

**You've completed your first scenario task modification.**
This pattern will come up repeatedly:

```plain
Open existing scenario task → Add/remove nodes → Configure parameters → Save → Verify
```

## Chapter 3: Building a New Scenario Task from Scratch

Chapters 1 and 2 covered "reading" and "modifying." This chapter tackles "building."

We'll still follow the "reference existing structure" method rather than starting from a completely blank slate.

### Scenario Description

Create a new **Zone Intrusion Detection** scenario task:

- Detect people in the frame
- Determine whether they've entered a specified zone
- Trigger an alarm after consecutive detections
- Display bounding boxes and labels in the live preview

Two advantages of this example:

- Uses only built-in capabilities — low barrier to entry
- Covers the complete loop: detection + zone rules + alarm + visualization

### 3.1 Create a New Algorithm

1. Navigate to **Scenario Tasks**.

<!-- Screenshot of scenario tasks list -->

![](images/img_21.webp)

2. Click **New Task**.

<!-- Screenshot of new task button -->

![](images/img_22.webp)

<!-- Screenshot of new task dialog -->

![](images/img_23.webp)

3. Fill in the basic information:

| Field            | Value                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Task Name        | Zone Intrusion Detection |
| Data Source Type | Video Analysis           |
| Task Type        | Detection/Analysis       |

<!-- Screenshot of filled form -->

![](images/img_24.webp)

Click **OK** to save.

<!-- Screenshot of saved task -->

![](images/img_25.webp)

### 3.2 Build the Pipeline

#### Preparation

Click **Pipeline Orchestration** to enter the blank orchestration page.

<!-- Screenshot of entering orchestration -->

![](images/img_26.webp)

An empty pipeline contains only the Start and End nodes.

<!-- Screenshot of empty pipeline -->

![](images/img_27.webp)

The plus button between nodes is used to add components.

<!-- Screenshot of plus button -->

![](images/img_28.webp)

Click the **plus button** to see the operation options. **Add Component** inserts algorithm components.

<!-- Screenshot of add component option -->

![](images/img_29.webp)

Click **Add Component** to open the component panel. For detailed component information, see **Appendix A: Node Quick Reference**.

<!-- Screenshot of component panel -->

![](images/img_30.webp)

Add nodes in the following order:

```plain
Video Decode → Object Detection → Object Tracking → Region Judgment → Sensitivity Calculation → Event Reporting
```

#### Step 1: Add Video Decode

The Video Decode node is the starting point for every scenario task. It converts a video stream into individual frames.

<!-- Screenshots of adding video decode -->

![](images/img_31.webp)
![](images/img_32.webp)

**Business logic configuration**: Click **Video Decode** to view configuration options. Video decode has no configurable parameters, so the panel is empty.

<!-- Screenshot of empty config panel -->

![](images/img_33.webp)

#### Step 2: Add Object Detection

Decoded frames are fed into the object detection model, which outputs target positions and class information.

<!-- Screenshots of adding object detection -->

![](images/img_34.webp)
![](images/img_35.webp)

**Business logic configuration**:

<!-- Screenshot of detection config -->

![](images/img_36.webp)

- Base Model: PedestrianDetection (Pedestrian Detection Model)
- Select Label: Pedestrian
- Custom Frame Rate: Enabled

#### Step 3: Add Object Tracking

Track detected targets across frames so the same person maintains a consistent identity, providing stable IDs for downstream business logic.

<!-- Screenshots of adding tracking -->

![](images/img_37.webp)
![](images/img_38.webp)

**Business logic configuration**:

<!-- Screenshot of tracking config -->

![](images/img_39.webp)

- Label Filter: PedestrianDetection — track this label
- State Judgment: Motion state
- Deformation Judgment: Not required

#### Step 4: Add Region Judgment

Draw a zone that defines the intrusion boundary — entering this zone triggers an alarm event.

<!-- Screenshots of adding region judgment -->

![](images/img_40.webp)
![](images/img_41.webp)

**Business logic configuration**:

<!-- Screenshot of region config -->

![](images/img_42.webp)

- Region Alarm Statistic Mode: Count limit (for absence/gathering detection)
- Input Region Type: Primary region

#### Step 5: Add Sensitivity Calculation

Single-frame alarms have high false positive rates. Sensitivity calculation requires multiple consecutive frame hits before triggering, significantly reducing noise.

<!-- Screenshots of adding sensitivity -->

![](images/img_43.webp)
![](images/img_44.webp)

**Business logic configuration**:

<!-- Screenshot of sensitivity config -->

![](images/img_45.webp)

#### Step 6: Add Event Reporting

Generated alarm events are reported to the system for statistical analysis and real-time push notifications.

<!-- Screenshots of adding event reporting -->

![](images/img_46.webp)
![](images/img_47.webp)

**Business logic configuration**:

<!-- Screenshot of event reporting config -->

![](images/img_48.webp)

- Target tracking: With target tracking
- Video clip for trigger events: Enabled
- Video clip for scheduled events: Disabled
- Large model review: Disabled

The complete Zone Intrusion Detection pipeline is now configured. Next, we'll set the detailed control parameters for each node.

### 3.4 Configure Key Parameters

In the previous section, the pipeline was built using default parameter values. To achieve high accuracy and low false positive rates, fine-grained parameter tuning is essential.

| Service won't start after saving  | Nodes not properly connected                                  | Check that all nodes are linked end-to-end      |
| No bounding boxes in live preview | Missing visualization overlay node                            | Add a visualization overlay at the end          |
| Boxes visible but no alarms       | Event reporting node missing or sensitivity threshold not met | Check the reporting node and threshold settings |
| Too many alarms                   | Missing sensitivity node or threshold too low                 | Raise the sensitivity threshold                 |
| Too many false positives          | No size filter or detection region too broad                  | Tighten the filter and shrink the region        |

### D. Common Pipeline Templates

#### Detection-Only Pipeline

```plain
Video Decode → Object Detection → Object Tracking → Event Reporting → Video Visualization Overlay
```

Good for: Pure object detection, foreign object detection, vehicle detection, etc.

#### Detection + Rule Pipeline

```plain
Video Decode → Object Detection → Object Tracking → Region/Line Judgment → Sensitivity → Event Reporting → Video Visualization Overlay
```

Good for: Zone intrusion, perimeter detection, pedestrian flow counting, etc.

#### Detection + Classification Pipeline

```plain
Video Decode → Object Detection → Object Tracking → Category Filter → Object Classification → Sensitivity → Event Reporting → Video Visualization Overlay
```

Good for: Hard hat, work uniform, smoking, phone usage detection, etc.
