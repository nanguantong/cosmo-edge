# Volume 5: Model Porting

> **Estimated time**: 30–45 minutes
> **Goal**: Learn to convert, upload, and integrate a third-party model into the system — completing a full loop from model porting to scenario task integration to result verification
> **Prerequisites**: Completed CosmoEdge Scenario Task Orchestration; understand basic pipeline orchestration concepts
> **Extra environment needed**: A computer with Docker installed for model conversion

**CosmoEdge Scenario Task Orchestration** covers "how to organize existing capabilities." This volume covers "how to bring in new ones." In other words:

+ **CosmoEdge Scenario Task Orchestration** teaches you to orchestrate pipelines
+ **CosmoEdge Third-Party Model Porting** teaches you to introduce third-party models

After completing this volume, you'll be able to:

+ Convert an ONNX model to a device-runnable `bmodel`
+ Upload the model to CosmoEdge
+ Configure model metadata and verify the model works
+ Integrate the third-party model into a new scenario task

## Learning Path

```plain
Prepare the model
  ↓
Convert inside Docker
  ↓
Upload to the system and fill in metadata
  ↓
Validate with images
  ↓
Integrate into a scenario task and run end-to-end testing
```

## Chapter 1: Prepare the Third-Party Model

This volume uses a publicly available **VisDrone detection model** as its example.

::: warning Model Repository Link
[VisDrone-YOLOv8-Models-Upgrade](https://github.com/superbabiiX/VisDrone-YOLOv8-Models-Upgrade/tree/main/visdrone%20models)
:::

We chose it for three reasons:

1. It's public and reusable — perfect for a tutorial example.
2. It's a standard object detection task, making results easy to verify.
3. Its categories differ from the built-in scenarios, proving the platform supports more than just bundled models.

### 1.1 Supported Input Formats

| Format             | Notes                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| ONNX               | Recommended — best compatibility |
| PyTorch `.pt`    | Must be exported to ONNX first    |
| TensorFlow `.pb` | Must be exported to ONNX first    |

> **Recommendation**
>
> For your first porting attempt, go with ONNX.
> This keeps the focus on "model conversion and integration" rather than framework export quirks.

### 1.2 Example Files for This Volume

Prepare an ONNX model file, for example:

```plain
visdrone_yolov8s.onnx
```

Place it in a local directory, such as:

```plain
/home/user/models/
```

> **Note**
>
> If you substitute your own model later, you'll need to update the filenames, input dimensions, and output names in the commands below accordingly.

## Chapter 2: Docker Environment Setup

Model conversion uses an official Docker image provided by Sophon (SOPHGO).

### 2.1 Install Docker

| Operating System | Installation Method                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu / Debian  | `sudo apt-get install docker.io`                                    |
| CentOS           | `sudo yum install docker`                                           |
| Windows          | Install[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |

### 2.3 Useful Docker Commands

| Command                                                                       | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `docker images`                                                             | List local images                          |
| `docker run -it -v /local/path:/container/path sophgo/tpuc_dev:latest bash` | Start a container with a mounted directory |
| `exit`                                                                      | Exit the container                         |

## Chapter 3: Model Conversion

Converting an ONNX model to a device-runnable `bmodel` takes just two core steps:

1. `model_transform`
2. `model_deploy`

### 3.1 Start the Container

```bash
docker run -it -v /home/user/models:/workspace sophgo/tpuc_dev:v3.2 bash
```

This command:

+ Starts the official conversion environment
+ Mounts your local model directory to `/workspace` inside the container

<!-- Screenshot of container start -->

![](images/img_07.webp)

### 3.2 Install Conversion Dependencies

```bash
pip install tpu_mlir -i https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/pypi/simple/
```

<!-- Screenshot of pip install -->

![](images/img_08.webp)

### 3.3 Step 1: Convert to MLIR

```bash
model_transform \
  --model_name visdrone_yolov8s \
  --model_def /workspace/visdrone_yolov8s.onnx \
  --input_shapes [[1,3,640,640]] \
  --pixel_format rgb \
  --output_names output0 \
  --mlir visdrone.mlir
```

<!-- Screenshots of conversion process -->

![](images/img_09.webp)

<!-- Screenshot of conversion complete -->

![](images/img_10.webp)

### 3.4 Step 2: Convert to bmodel

```bash
model_deploy \
  --mlir visdrone.mlir \
  --quantize F16 \
  --chip bm1688 \
  --model visdrone_yolov8s_f16.bmodel
```

<!-- Screenshot of bmodel conversion -->

![](images/img_11.webp)

After conversion, the `/workspace` directory will contain:

```plain
visdrone_yolov8s_f16.bmodel
```

<!-- Screenshot of output file -->

![](images/img_12.webp)

### 3.4 Three Key Points to Watch

1. `--input_shapes` must match the model's training/export configuration.
2. `--pixel_format` must match the preprocessing used during training.
3. `--output_names` must match the actual output tensor names from the model export.

## Chapter 4: Upload the Model to CosmoEdge

### 4.1 Open the Model Repository

1. Navigate to **Model Repository**.

<!-- Screenshot of model repository -->

![](images/img_13.webp)

| Sub Type      | yolov8_det                                                                          | Matches the model's YOLO version |
| Model Name    | VisDrone Drone Detection                                                            | For easy identification          |
| Upload File   | `visdrone_yolov8s_f16.bmodel`                                                     | The converted model file         |
| Normalization | 0–1                                                                                |                                  |
| Color Channel | RGB                                                                                 |                                  |
| Class Labels  | pedestrian, people, bicycle, car, van, truck, tricycle, awning-tricycle, bus, motor | For category display and mapping |

Click **OK** to save.

### 4.2 Post-Upload Checklist

After uploading, verify:

+ The model appears in the Model Repository list.
+ Status shows as normal.
+ Name, type, input dimensions, and labels are all correct.

<!-- Screenshot of model in repository -->

> Accurate model metadata is critical. Errors here are difficult to debug later.

## Chapter 5: Validate the Model with Image Testing

Before integrating the model into a scenario task pipeline, run a lightweight validation first.

### 5.1 Prepare Test Images

Gather several images that match the model's target domain — for example, aerial drone-view photographs.

### 5.2 Create an Image Validation Task

1. Go to **Scenario Tasks** and create a new drone image detection task.

<!-- Screenshot of scenario tasks list -->

![](images/img_19.webp)

<!-- Screenshot of new task dialog -->

![](images/img_20.webp)

<!-- Screenshot of task saved -->

![](images/img_21.webp)

2. Create the pipeline for **Drone Image Detection**.

Click **Pipeline Orchestration** to enter the orchestration page.

### 5.3 Results Analysis

<!-- Screenshot of detailed results -->

![](images/img_28.webp)

Results analysis:

+ Pedestrians, vehicles, and other targets in the image are successfully detected.
+ Bounding box positions are generally accurate.
+ Class names display correctly — not as numbers or blank labels.

> If image validation doesn't pass, don't rush into pipeline integration.
> Go back and check:
>
> + Was the model file uploaded correctly?
> + Do the input dimensions match?
> + Are all class labels configured properly?

## Chapter 6: Integrate the Third-Party Model into a Scenario Task

Now let's integrate this model into an actual business workflow.

### Scenario Description

Create a new **Drone Object Detection** scenario task:

+ Detect pedestrians and vehicles in the frame
+ Generate events
+ Display bounding boxes and class labels on the live feed

### 6.1 Create a New Algorithm

1. Go to **Scenario Tasks** → **New Task**.

<!-- Screenshot of new task dialog -->

![](images/img_29.webp)

Fill in the basic information:

+ Task Name: Drone Object Detection
+ Data Source Type: Video Analysis
+ Task Type: Detection/Analysis

<!-- Screenshot of saved task -->

![](images/img_30.webp)

### 6.2 Build the Minimum Viable Pipeline

Add nodes in this order:

```plain
Video Decode → Object Detection (third-party model) → Object Tracking → Region Alarm Judgment → Event Reporting
```

1. Click **Pipeline Orchestration** to enter the orchestration page.

<!-- Screenshot of empty pipeline -->

![](images/img_31.webp)

2. Add the orchestration logic:

Alarm popup:

![](images/img_44.webp)

Verify:

+ Bounding boxes appear in the frame.
+ Class labels display correctly.
+ Different targets maintain consistent tracking.

### 7.3 Check Alarm Records

Go to **Event Center** → **Detection/Analysis** to review alarm event records.

<!-- Screenshot of alarm records -->

![](images/img_45.webp)

Results analysis: Alarm events are recorded normally, confirming the pipeline is working correctly.

### 7.4 Success Criteria

If all three of the following are true, your third-party model porting is complete:

1. Image testing produces correct results.
2. The scenario task starts successfully.
3. Both live preview and alarm records show expected output.

### A. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

| Problem                                        | Possible Cause                                                   | Solution                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model uploaded but no detections               | Input dimensions configured incorrectly                          | Verify model metadata matches conversion parameters         |
| Classes show as numbers                        | Class labels not configured                                      | Add the label mapping in Model Repository                   |
| Scenario task starts but no bounding boxes     | Missing OSD overlay node                                         | Add an OSD overlay at the end of the pipeline               |
| Image testing works but video results are poor | Test video distribution differs significantly from training data | Try a video that better matches the model's training domain |
| Service fails to start                         | Nodes not properly connected or model type mismatch              | Check pipeline structure and model type settings            |
